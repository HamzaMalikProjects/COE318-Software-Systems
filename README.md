## 📘 Overview

This repository contains a collection of lab assignments for **COE 318 – Software Systems**. The course introduced students to the complete software development lifecycle—requirements, design, implementation, testing, and debugging—through object-oriented programming in Java. Labs focused on modular design, class decomposition, and the integration of independently developed components.

## 🧪 Lab Descriptions

### 🔹 Lab 01 – Complex Number Objects  
Implemented a `ComplexNumber` class supporting arithmetic operations and object-oriented behavior (e.g., encapsulation, immutability).

### 🔹 Lab 02 – Linked Counters  
Designed a counter system using linked objects to simulate multi-digit counters, reinforcing constructor chaining and object collaboration.

### 🔹 Lab 03 – Bank Accounts  
Developed a `BankAccount` system with deposit, withdrawal, and transfer logic. Introduced account relationships and basic transaction integrity.

### 🔹 Lab 04 – Blackjack  
Built a text-based Blackjack game with basic AI. Covered control flow, object interaction, input handling, and program testing.

### 🔹 Lab 05 – Resistive Circuits  
Simulated resistive electrical circuits using object-oriented design to represent circuit elements and compute equivalent resistance.

### 🔹 Lab 06 – Analog Circuit  
Extended the circuit simulator to include analog behavior. Focused on abstraction, inheritance, and advanced class hierarchies.
